Bank of Abyssinia,1,-0.8758,"It say ""The request was not successful. please check device connectivity or try again"" why? One of the bank manager told me it is because of my phone's android version which is 9.1 It is ridiculous! Disappointing",2024-09-11

Dashen Bank,1,-0.8735,"This might be the worst banking app I've ever used I dont know why kind of bug it is but suddenly the apps stops working it says ""Temporarily unavailable"" for a simple feature like viewing account balance and in person visit was no help it took them longer than 2 hours to fix it and even after that 2 weeks later the same problem just because of this I'm going to stop using the bank altogether which is a shame because it's a decent bank",2025-11-01
Dashen Bank,1,-0.8681,Cannot list the number of bugs with this pile of human waste. The absolute worst banking app I have ever used. 50 steps backwards. DO NOT RECOMMEND.,2025-07-02
Bank of Abyssinia,1,-0.8587,"I will give only one star, because it faced with multiple of problems. 1. The app is not as fast as the other banks App, for e.g like CBE 2. The App asks repeatedly to switch off developer options, even if it is switched off. 3. Bank of Abyssinia's services are interesting, but they ignored the issues on the App service. 4. Most customers gave a complain on the App, but no one accept their complain to fix the issue. 5. Lastly, I will not recommend the App unless the issue has been solved ASAP!!",2025-01-03
Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,1,-0.8466,"Seriously, what’s going on with this app? The ""Pay to Beneficiary"" option is completely disabled for Android users, yet iOS users get full access without restrictions. Why are Android users being treated like second class customers? It’s the same app, the same service, but clearly not the same experience. This kind of platform bias is unacceptable, either give everyone the same features or be transparent about why you’re limiting functionality. Right now, it just feels unfair and frustrating.",2025-11-15
Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,1,-0.8279,"WHAT A USELESS APP! Transfers, wallet payments, other banks — nothing works. Updated, restarted, cleared cache, reinstalled — still useless. Crashed and forced me to visit a branch just to log in 3 times. One of the biggest banks in the country can’t fix issues a junior developer could solve. Completely unreliable. Big bank , Zero functionality!",2025-09-13
Dashen Bank,1,-0.8158,The worst app ever. Extremely unreliable. Such a shame for a big bank.,2025-10-31
Dashen Bank,1,-0.8122,"Dashen SuperApp is the worst app for me because it consistently fails during transfers. When I try to send money, the transaction freezes for extended periods—sometimes a full day, and often two or three days or more. Crucially, the funds are neither delivered to the recipient nor immediately refunded to my account, which is incredibly frustrating and makes me feel like I've lost my money. The app urgently needs a technical update to ensure transactions process smoothly and reliably.",2025-10-14
