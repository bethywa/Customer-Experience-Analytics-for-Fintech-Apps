Recommendations

Commercial Bank of Ethiopia:
- Investigate slow transfer flows on high-load endpoints (evidence: 'slow', 'loading' counts)
- Improve onboarding UI elements; reduce clicks for frequent tasks

Bank of Abyssinia:
- Stabilize app to reduce crashes (evidence: many 'crash' mentions)
- Optimize network handling for low-connectivity scenarios

Dashen Bank:
- Add in-app help and clearer error messages for failed transactions
- Prioritize performance improvements for older devices


Ethics:

Ethical notes:
- Reviews are self-selected (survivorship / negativity bias).
- May be skewed to recent events or specific user segments (power users).
- Language coverage: some reviews in Amharic were removed; this may bias results away from non-English voices.
- Use anonymized examples & avoid exposing PII in reports.
